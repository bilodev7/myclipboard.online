## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with two main components:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - Server-side rendered React application
   - Real-time updates via Socket.IO
   - Responsive design with TailwindCSS

2. **Backend (NestJS)**
   - RESTful API for clipboard operations
   - WebSocket server for real-time communication
   - File upload and management
   - Redis integration for data persistence
